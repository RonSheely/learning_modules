    "This is an interactive notebook for playing around with the temperature and interaction parameter $\\beta$ and observing the effect on the resulting free energy curves of a binary ideal or regular solution. Following that, there is a small section for readers to complete their own code to generate the phase diagram for an ideal or regular solution model. There are [similar demos](http://www.learncheme.com/simulations/thermodynamics/thermo-2/effect-of-temperature-on-partial-miscibility) available online, but I couldn't find one that was interactive in this way and written in Python. Thermodynamics is fairly math-heavy and a tough subject to master, but I believe having quality visualizations can have a large, positive impact on your learning. I hope you will find this notebook functional, readable, and educational."

    "## How to run this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are viewing this notebook on Google Colaboratory, then all the software is already set up for you (hooray). If you want to run the notebook locally, make sure all the Python libraries in the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/blob/master/requirements.txt) file are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "In the first half of this notebook, everything is completed for you and you just have to run it. To execute each cell of the notebook and automatically advance to the next cell, press `Shift+Enter`. Or you can click `Run All` in the menu at the top. When done successfully, you'll see a widget slider pop up that you can adjust and observe the changes in the free energy curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "In the second half, there are a few sections for you to complete the code in order to construct the resulting phase diagram. This is delineated with the dashed lines as follows, and you should **only change what's inside**. You don't have to edit the text or code anywhere else. I've also included \"**TODO**\" to separate the background context from the actual instructions.\n",

    "# ---------------------- #\n",
    "# YOUR CODE HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---------------------- #\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you edit the code in a cell, just press `Shift+Enter` to run it again. You have to execute **all** the code cells in this notebook from top to bottom (so don't skip around). A number `[#]` will appear to the left of the code cell once it's done executing. When done successfully, you'll be able to generate a lens-shaped phase diagram at the very end.\n",

A miscibility gap is where, below a certain critical temperature $T_c$, the single-phase solid solution will phase separate into two immiscible phases with different concentrations. In fact, many phase diagrams have both a miscibility gap and a solid+liquid region; they're usually not shown on the same plot because they're separated by a large temperature difference. This was one of many aspects of MATSCI 201A that blew my mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The miscibility gap arises at low temperatures in the regular solution model when the $\\beta$ parameter is large and $T$ is small. We'll find the common tangent on *just* the $\\Delta G^s$ curve, and the tangent points will demarcate the **solvus** surrounding the miscibility gap.\n",
