In all the times I've learned XRD (which is something like 5 different classes at this point), I have never once seen a discussion for how these various parameters *precisely* result in the spectra we observe using a diffractometer.

    "There are *so* many ways you can improve this notebook. Here are just a few ideas:\n",
    "* [Easy] Does the same code structure work for a different crystal structure, such as body-centered cubic or diamond cubic? I've provided some data above for you to use.\n",
    "* [Medium] How does **temperature** affect our sample and the resulting XRD spectra? How might you incorporate these effects into the code?\n",
    "* [Medium] Can you [annotate](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.annotate.html) the plot so we know which plane corresponds to each peak? This is good practice with [list comprehension](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python) and the snazzy [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) syntax.\n",
    "* [Hard] If you haven't done so already, can you write `compute_F()` in a single return line? Hint: Clever use of matrix multiplication and [`np.sum()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html). What about the other functions?\n",
    "* [Hard] Instead of a stem plot, what if you modeled the peaks with [Gaussians](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html)? The really cool part of having a width is the ability to incorporate **thickness effects** through the [Scherrer equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scherrer_equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "I've implemented a few of the above ideas in [this other demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enze-chen/learning_modules/blob/master/mse/XRD_trends.ipynb). You can also reference that notebook if you get stuck on any of the above parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also if you want to see the calculated spectra for more structures and compounds, you can find them on [The Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)."
