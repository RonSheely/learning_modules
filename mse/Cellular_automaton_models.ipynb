I created this notebook because I find CA to be quite fascinating and capable of modeling complex physical phenomena, but they are often glossed over or ignored entirely in computational materials science courses. This is a shame because they're actually quite easy to understand! I hope you find this notebook instructive and enjoyable."

    "For pedagogical reasons, there are a few sections for you to complete the code in order to construct the CA. This is delineated with the dashed lines as follows, and you should **only change what's inside**. You don't have to edit the text or code anywhere else.

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "CA were discovered in the 1940s by [Stanislaw Ulam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam) and [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) at Los Alamos National Laboratory in their work on self-replicating models for artifical life. CA were then brought to the attention of the general public in the 1970s by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in his namesake [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and in the 1980s by [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram), who in 2002 published his findings in his book [*A New Kind of Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science). \n",
    "\n",
    "In one sentence, traditional CA model the **dynamic** evolution of a **discrete** system by applying a set of **deterministic** rules. We elaborate more on this in the following subsection. Despite their simplicity, CA can model a variety of complex biological (e.g. reproduction) and physical phenomena (e.g. non-equilibrium thermodynamics like the [Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction)). Some CA can even emulate a universal [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure and rules\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name implies, CA are composed of **cells** arranged in a discretized grid that is often rectangular, which we adopt here. The rectangular grid makes it convenient to index the cells with $(i,j)$, as shown in the figure below. In the traditional formulation, we restrict each cell to be in one of only two discrete **states** which you can think of as `on/off`, `alive/dead`, `dark/light`, or simply `1/0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CA neighbors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/master/fig/CA_neighbors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The states of each cell will evolve over several discrete time steps (creating successive **generations**) according to a set of **transition rules** and the states of the other cells in their local **neighborhood**. The two common neighborhoods considered in CA simulations are the **von-Neumann neighborhood** (four nearest neighbors, orange above) and the **Moore neighborhood** (also include four next-nearest neighbors, orange and blue above). Cells along the boundary of the simulation domain will have a neighborhood specified by periodic boundary conditions (i.e. wraps to the other side). Note that all cells update their states **simultaneously**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of what these transition rules look like, here are the four rules that govern [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), which considers the Moore neighborhood. Normally the user specifies their choice of the inital conditions of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n",
    "1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "1. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "1. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems simple right? It is! But these simple rules can lead to very complex behavior. Check out the Wikipedia page linked above for examples or [this insane YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE)."

    "## Our task\n",
    "\n",
    "We will conduct two simulations using cellular automata: [recrystallization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recrystallization_(metallurgy)) and [spinodal decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition). Recrystallization is the process by which strain-free and equiaxed grains nucleate and grow in a cold-worked metal, restoring its structure and properties to their original form. Spinodal decomposition is the spontaneous transformation of an alloy into two phases and notably 1) does not require nucleation, and 2) travels against the concentration gradient. These are two very important processes in MSE and we'll see if we can capture their qualitative behaviors."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this notebook taught you a little bit about cellular automata and metallurgy theory, and gave you some Python practice. It was only an introduction, and I recommend checking out the links in the [Introduction](#Acknowledgements) if you want to learn more about CA. If you have any remaining questions or ideas for this and other modules, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n",

    "## Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can you change the recrystallization CA simulation to consider a different neighborhood?\n",
    "* Can you change the transition rules to be probabilistic instead of deterministic? For example, grain growth under impingement conditions can occur with a probability $p$ instead of deterministically.\n",
    "* For spinodal decomposition, what happens if you change the values of $D$ and $A$? What about the initial range of $\\eta$?\n",
