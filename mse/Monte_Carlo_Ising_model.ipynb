    "This notebook guides you through the steps of setting up a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the 2D ferromagnetic [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) and observing the characteristic phase transition at the critical temperature $T_c$. For more details, see the classical work by [Onsager, L. *Physical Review*, **65**, 1944](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.65.117). We will use a $NVT$ ensemble and the [Metroplis-Hastings algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm). This notebook is far from being original as several similar notebooks exist online, but I have tried to keep the code simple and explanations plentiful so that *beginners* to Python and computational MSE can successfully complete everything."

    "\n",
    "If you are viewing this notebook on Google Colaboratory, then all the software is already set up for you (hooray). If you want to run the notebook locally, make sure all the Python libraries in the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/blob/master/requirements.txt) file are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pedagogical reasons, there are a few sections for you to complete the code in order to run the simulation. These are delineated with the dashed lines as follows, and you should **only change what's inside**. You don't have to edit the text or code anywhere else. I've also included \"**TODO**\" to separate the background context from the actual instructions.\n",

A number `[#]` will appear to the left of the code cell once it's done executing. When all done successfully, you should be able to see a few images of your system and plots of the system properties as a function of $T$.\n",

    "## Important equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) is one of the simplest models for magnetism where the magnetic dipole moments (\"spins\") are discrete values from the set $\\{+1, -1\\}$ corresponding to `up` and `down` spins, respectively. We will work with a 2D square lattice, so the spin at location $(i,j)$ will be denoted by $\\sigma_{ij}$. The 2D square lattice Ising model is also one of the simplest systems to display a *phase transition*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation we must write down is the **Hamiltonian**, which in our case will only feature an **exchange interaction** parameter $J$ that is positive for ferromagnetism (we ignore the magnetic field interaction parameter $h$). Furthermore, this exchange interaction only applies to nearest-neighbors where we will also assume **periodic boundary conditions**. Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(\\sigma) = -J \\sum_{\\langle p,q \\rangle} \\sigma_{p_i,p_j} \\sigma_{q_i,q_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\langle p,q \\rangle$ represent a summation over adjacent lattice sites only. We'll be using the [Metroplis-Hastings algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) for the MC simulation, which has the following steps for each iteration through the cycle. As we begin coding, we'll find ways of optimizing the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a site $(i,j)$ at random.\n",
    "1. Calculate the change in energy, $\\Delta E$, if the sign at that site was flipped.\n",
    "1. If $\\Delta E \\le 0$, accept the change by keeping the new spin because we've lowered the total energy of our system.\n",
    "1. If $\\Delta E > 0$, generate a random number $r \\in [0, 1]$.\n",
    "    1. Accept the change only if $r < \\exp (-\\beta \\Delta E)$ where $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_BT}$ and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n",
    "    1. Otherwise, return the spin to the original state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since our goal is to simulate a phase transition, there must be properties of the system that we can track. The properties that are relevant to us are the expected values of the system's **energy** ($E$) and **magnetization** ($M$), where the expected value of a quantity $Q$ over **both space and time** is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\langle Q \\rangle_{N,T} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{s=1}^{N} Q_{s,t} \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the expected values will allow us to calculate the **heat capacity** per site and **magnetic susceptibility** per site, which are given respectively by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = \\frac{\\langle E^2 \\rangle - \\langle E \\rangle^2}{k_B T^2 L^2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi = \\frac{\\langle M^2 \\rangle - \\langle M \\rangle^2}{k_B T L^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is the size of one dimension. At the phase transition, we should see a divergence in these two quantities (which might not be perfect due to finite size effects).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known issues\n",
    "\n",
    "* As the code isn't heavily optimized, it will be slow if you run it for too many iterations or for too large of a system. Please be gentle. ❤"
