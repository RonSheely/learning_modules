If you want to run the notebook locally, make sure all the Python libraries in the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/blob/master/requirements.txt) file are installed.\n",

    "For pedagogical reasons, there are a few sections for you to complete the code in order to construct the resulting free energy curves. This is delineated with the dashed lines as follows, and you should **only change what's inside**. You don't have to edit the text or code anywhere else. I've also included \"**TODO**\" to separate the background context from the actual instructions.\n",

A number `[#]` will appear to the left of the code cell once it's done executing. When done successfully, you'll be able to generate a lens-shaped phase diagram at the very end.\n",

    "\n",
    "We know from thermodynamics that in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta H$ is the enthalpy, $T$ is the temperature, and $\\Delta S$ is the entropy. Hopefully this is ingrained in your head by now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ideal solution model, we assume no interactions between the species, which means $\\Delta H_{\\text{mix}} = 0$ and we only have to account for the entropy of mixing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = -R \\left[ x \\ln x + (1-x) \\ln(1-x) \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the atomic fraction of species $B$ in the $AB$ solution. One can derive this expression by starting from the configurational entropy in the [microcanonical ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcanonical_ensemble) and apply [Stirling's approximation](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Math/stirling.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the regular solution model, however, we have an interaction term in the enthalpy that in the simplest version is typically given by the product of the atomic fractions times a $\\beta$ interaction parameter, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{mix}} = \\beta x(1-x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta < 0$ favors mixing. Furthermore, we'll assume for this demo that the free energies of the pure phases are $0$ as a reference.\n",
    "\n",
