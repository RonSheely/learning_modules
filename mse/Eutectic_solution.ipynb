    "This is an interactive notebook for playing around with the temperature and observing the effect on the resulting free energy curves of a eutetic system (phase diagram shown above) described by the regular solution model. Thermodynamics is fairly math-heavy and a tough subject to master, but I believe having quality visualizations can have a large, positive impact on your learning. I hope you will find this notebook functional, readable, and educational."

    "## How to run this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are viewing this notebook on Google Colaboratory, then all the software is already set up for you (hooray). If you want to run the notebook locally, make sure all the Python libraries in the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/blob/master/requirements.txt) file are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, everything is completed for you and you just have to run it. If you want to try coding yourself, you can look at other [thematically similar notebooks](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/tree/master/mse) that I've created, or delete sections of the code below. To execute each cell of the notebook and automatically advance to the next cell, press `Shift+Enter`. Or you can click `Run All` in the menu at the top. When done successfully, you'll see a widget slider pop up near the middle that you can adjust and observe the changes in the free energy curves. At the very end we will use the code to draw a eutectic phase diagram.\n",
