# Installing Python and Atom

This is a set of instructions to help guide you as you install Python and associated files on your computer. 
For this process, I typically like to accompany my mentee as they go through it, just to make sure that everything installs correctly without a hitch.
I know what it's like to be excited to start a software project, only to be blocked by troubleshooting the installation, so I don't want this misfortune to befall anyone.


## The Anaconda distribution

The native [Python language](https://www.python.org/) is already quite powerful, but there are several bells and whistles that have been developed by the community to make it even more powerful and user-friendly.
At some point, people realized that it made sense to bundle these along with the default Python code, and arguably the most popular **distribution** of Python is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), or "conda" for short.
